# Interfacing-LED-with-8051-Microcontroller-Circuit

 The main principle of this circuit is to interface LEDs to the 8051 family micro controller.
 Commonly, used LEDs will have voltage drop of 1.7v and current of 10mA to glow at full intensity.
 This is applied through the output pin of the micro controller.
